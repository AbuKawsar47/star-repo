        <p><strong>A blistering hundred from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/abukawsarofficial47">Abu Kawsar</a></strong> helped Ali Ahmed school and College post a mammoth 439-run total against South Point School and College and subsequently register a huge 283-run win in the Prime Bank Young Tiger School Cricket tournament yesterday.</p>
        <p>Electing to bat, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/abukawsarofficial47">Abu Kawsar</a> struck a 98-ball 167-run knocke laced with 24 fours and 8 sixes</strong> while <b>Abdullah Al Jubair added a quickie-fire 39-ball  77-run</b> as Ali Ahmed posted 439-run for eight in 50 overs.</p>
        <p>In reply <i>South Point</i> were all-out on just 156-runs in 24.5 overs.</p>
